# Palm Detection

This repository represents a generic file structure that needs to be made to put different tensorflow models in use by training
them over custom object images and creating a tf record file that needs to be fed into the tensorflow pipeline.

Here we have trained a model to detect palms using Faster - RCNN (details can be found in the config file), about 130 something images 
have been used in total along with train and test since we had a single cassifier to train. All the necessary files are here along with 
the trained model.
